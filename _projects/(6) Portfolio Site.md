## Development Summary

- **Made with:** Jekyll Themes, Figma
- **Time in Development:** 2 Weeks

<br>

## Overview

I coded this website using the [portfolYOU Jekyll Theme](https://github.com/youssefraafatnasry/PortfolYOU). The site is hosted on Github Pages and uses a custom domain from Google Domains.

I also used Figma in order to create all of the mockups used in this porfolio.

This portfolio was a fun project that allowed me to combine an old passion for coding with a newer passion of design. Prior to Statistics, I was a Computer Science major and I found coding and building things to be a lot of fun. This project allowed me to pick up some of my old skills and put them to use as I enter into a new field. 

The Static Site Generator framework allowed me a lot of flexibility that I hope to use even more in the future. I hope to continue to add to my portfolio and begin to write blogs where I will document my transition from Teaching into Learning Experience Design.
