## Overview


Calculus is the culmination of all K-12 Mathematics and its applications are essential for many other fields and sciences. The development and application of Calculus is one of the most significant factors in the development of modern sciences. 

In recent years, Mathematics Education has been advanced with the use of digital mediums. From my experience as a Mathematics Educator most of the development has taken place in Mathematics Eduation for children (and rightfully so). However, considering the importance of Calculus in modern sciences, I found the resources for learning Calculus were outdated and limited.

## Challenge


While Calculus is a very visual discipline, majority of the resources use complex formulas and jargon to communicate visual concepts. This learning experience resuts in cognitive overload and adds confusion, discouraging further interest. For isntance, a graph and an equation may be provided to explain a theorem but the student would have read the equation several times to understand the words, recognize the individual terms in the equation, put the terms together to see the big picture, and relate this big picture to the graph.

## Goal

Create an interactive tool for students that will allow them to digest complex Calculus theorems easily.

## Ideation

As a Mathematics Educator and Mathematics Undergraduate student, I was the acting Subject Matter Expert for this project.

Essential Calculus theorems were picked and students would prove them. Students go step-by-step in proving various theorems in order to decrease cognitive overload.

Theory applied during storyboarding:
- Cognitive Load Theory.
- Contructivism Theory applied where students take control of their own learning.
- Students take part in the highest level of thinking according to Bloom's Taxonomy: creating.

## Design 

Calculus (and math in general) is often a stress point for many students and so softer shades of green were used in order to invoke calming and optimism. Minimalistic design was also applied to all of the graphs in order to reduce cognitive load. Each step was designed to be very intuitive and the low number of steps per proof was used in order to encourage continued interest.

The goal was for the learner to be able to say "wow that was so simple".

## Development

Articulate Storyline 360 was used in order to create drag-and-drop interactions where students would fulfill one step of a proof at a time before being able to move on to the next step. This was custom built with the use of updating variables to trigger layers that allow students to move on.

For each of the pages that stated the theorems, students are able to hover over each color coordinated term in order to see how the equation relates back to the equation. This allows for students to skip the steps of reading the theorem and recognizing terms. Instead, they can visually identify parts of the theorem to the corresponding parts of the graph.
