## Development Summary

- **Made with:** Articulate Storyline 360
- **Time in Development:** ~5 hours
- **Responsibilities:** LX Design, Graphic Design, Development

<br>

## Overview

As I study about the field of Learning and Development, I come across many theories and concepts such as Bloom's Taxonomy. I created this project for two reasons:

1. To practice using tabs interactions in Storyline 360. 

2. Study Bloom's Taxonomy by creating an infographic that I would be able to use which holds all of its key concepts.

<br>

## Challenge

As I studied adult learning theories and concepts related to Learning and Development, I come across many infographics that pack all of the information in one screen. Personally, I find it difficult to process all of the information being presented to me when it is shown all at once.


<br>

## Goal

Reduce cognitive overload when learning about Bloom's Taxonomy.

<br>

## Design and Development

The pyramid amd varied colors are iconic to Bloom's Taxonomy infographics so I wanted to keep the recognizable look. Instead of compacting all of the information onto one screen, Storyline 360 allows for the use of triggers to enable layers which I used to display the relevant information. I also experimented with object states so that the users will be able to intuitively recognize that each section of the pyramid has more information.
