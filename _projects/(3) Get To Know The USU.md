## Overview

As I entered college, I was intimidated with the size of the campus and quickly got confused as to what was where. The maps that I found online were difficult to understand and provided too much information at once for me to really understand where things really were. I stumbled across [this project](https://community.articulate.com/e-learning-examples/storyline-get-to-know-your-site) from the E-Learning Heroes website where they help someone get to know their own site though an interactive map. I really enjoyed the isometric design and the functionality of the objects in the project and so I wanted to try my own hand at something similar. I combined this idea with my experience in college and recreated the University Student Union at California State University, Northridge.

<br>

## Goal

Create an interactive map of CSUN's University Student Union.

<br>

## Design 

Inspired by the e-learning example from E-Learning Heroes, I wanted to create an isometric design of CSUN's USU. I used Inkscape to create isometric vector images of each building and layout the buildings prior to development in Articulate Storyline.

<br>

## Development

I developed the interactivity of the map in Articulate Storyline. I used layers and animation paths so that the user can hover over individual buildings and manage cognitive load.

Overall, the project could have taken far fewer hours if I chose to use pre-made building designs, but I wanted to challenge myself to learn new tools and tackle a project from start to finish.
